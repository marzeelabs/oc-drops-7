"Bioinformatician position","How does Polycomb composition influence its regulatory functions?","<p>The appointed scientist will investigate how the composition of Polycomb complexes influences its genome-wide localization and its gene regulatory functions. This will be done by integrating ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, proteomic, and biochemical data</p><p>Demonstrated experience in analyzing genome-wide data (ChIP-seq and RNA-seq) is required. The candidate is expected to have strong computational programming skills, and background knowledge in transcription and epigenetics is highly desirable.</p>",01/01/2013:12/31/2016,"Post-doc (ER)","3",hr@example.org,ahayes,"University College London",Open
"Management activities coordination of the consortium","","These activities comprise the chairing of a Steering Committee which will meet every year during the General Assembly. It is composed of one representative per Beneficiary. The consortium, including all Beneficiaries, will meet annually, coincident with the General Assembly, preparing the Annual Report. The Steering Committee will be in charge of the operational management of all the activities of the project. Protection of intellectual property as well as dissemination and exploitation of results and new knowledge obtained within the consortium is of high priority and will be coordinated by the Steering Committee.",,,1,,anistal,"Center for Genomic Regulation (CRG)",Filled
"Male genome reprogramming by histone variants and histone modifications during spermatogenesis in the mouse","This ESR's goal will be to characterize the histoneacetyl-transferase(s) and complex(es) responsible for triggering and regulatingthe genome-wide histone hyperacetylation wave preceding the post-meiotic re-organisationof the male genome.","The consequences of histone acetylation disruption on the male genome will be explored not only during spermiogenesis, but also after fertilization, by using mouse ICSI approaches. Our data in the mouse model will also be compared with observations in the Drosophila model, in which a wave of histone acetylation was also recently described by Renate Renkawitz-Pohl, and a short stay in Renate's lab will enable to get more familiar with this model. During a short stay in Willy Baarends's lab, he/she will explore the epigenetic marking of the sex chromosomes.",12/31/2012:11/31/2015,"PhD (ESR)",1,,gsmith,"Instituto Superior Tecnico",Closed
