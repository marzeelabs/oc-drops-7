"1st Annual Meeting",05/04/2012,IT,Naples,Via Partenope 36,80121,"The  Annual Meeting will be held in Naples. The progress made in the first period of the project will be highlighted through scientific talks from PIs and junior members on 5 March, and discussions about the future direction, collaborations, and management will take place on 6 March. Numerous opportunities for networking within the consortium will be provided, including two tours of Naples and dinners in 'local' restaurants off the tourist path. The venue will be the Aula Magna, directly at the seaside.",Meeting,"naples.jpg"

"Linux workshop",01/21/2014:01/25/2014,BE,Brussels,Pleinlaan 2,1000,"<p>This workshop, sponsored by the project Open Consortium, is aimed at current and prospective users of the <a href='http://www.copasi.org'>COPASI</a> modeling and simulation package for system biology. The workshop is directed both at beginners as well as advanced users and there will be sessions directed at each of these groups (in parallel if needed). The workshop will also be an important means for the COPASI development team to collect feedback from users about improving the software.</p><p><a href='http://www.copasi.org'>COPASI</a> is a free, open-source, software package for creating and simulating systems biology models. COPASI runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux and it is a user-friendly software that allows for construction of kinetic models without much knowledge of mathematics. However COPASI is also equipped with advanced algorithms and is a powerful tool for modeling and simulation, with some features that are not available in other simulators.</p><p>The workshop will cover several features of modeling and simulation by using examples of previously published models. The set of topics covered are:</p><ul><li>Basic Modeling and Simulation. How to create biochemical kinetic models, and find out their dynamic behavior and steady-state properties.</li><li>Sensitivity Analysis. Study of the importance of parameters in determining the values of model variables. This includes local as well as global sensitivity analysis.</li><li>Optimization. How to use numerical optimization methods to explore the properties of large and complex models.This includes the use of optimization in strategies for metabolic engineering.</li><li>Parameter Estimation. How to use experimental data to calibrate models to represent real biological systems accurately. This includes analysis of enzyme kinetic experiments, and in vivo time courses of cell biology experiments, among other applications.</li><li>Stochastic Simulation. COPASI's capabilities for running Gillespie's algorithm, as well as for automatically converting ODE-based models to the stochastic representation.</li><li>Integration with other Software Packages. How to use COPASI together with other applications that support SBML (e.g. Biomodels database, CellDesigner and SBW)</li><li>Advanced topics &ndash; several features such as the command line version, using COPASI on distributed computing, and web services.</li></ul><p>The COPASI workshop is led by Pedro Mendes and Kieran Smallbone.</p>","Workshop","gnu.jpg"

As our instructors were experienced researchers, participants received expert advice on their research project, had the opportunity to develop their career, and established new contacts and collaborations.</p><ul><li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.</li><li>Aliquam tincidunt mauris eu risus.</li><li>Vestibulum auctor dapibus neque.</li></ul>"
"Creating Life in 3D - CEITEC Annual Conference 'Frontiers in Material and Life Sciences'",09/02/2015:09/04/2015,CZ,Brno,,60200,"<p> This <a href='http://www.ceitec.eu/creating-life-in-3d/'>conference</a> will be our first conference with speakers from both CEITEC and ICRC to explore the interface of the life sciences and material sciences fields on the topic of 3-dimensional life. This event will bring several international scientific speakers together in a program designed to maximise the time for scientists from multiple disciplines to discuss mutual ideas in solving some of the most important scientific questions of today. The program will include plenary sessions, poster sessions and several social events. The conference will take a place in Brno, Czech Republic.
