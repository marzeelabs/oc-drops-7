WP2,"<p><strong>At the heart of ISBE is an infrastructure for the integration and synthesis of systems biology across the Data Generation, Integration and Stewardship Centres identified by the project. The distributed, interconnected infrastructure envisaged depends on the adoption of best practices, standards, technical infrastructure, software and capacity for data and model management and distribution. Model and data management covers technical, social and educational aspects.</strong></p><ul><li>To comprehensively survey the state of the art and best practices for model and data management for Systems Biology in Europe.</li><li>To propose and promote a framework and best practices for model and data management for Systems Biology in Europe.</li><li>To collaborate with standardisation activities for model and data management.</li></ul><p>The work is largely the collection, analysis and distribution of information. We will combine literature analysis and direct communication with the community, using a variety of face to face meetings, virtual interactions with modern web communication and targeted liaisons with significant networks, projects, centres and societies such as COMBINE and SysMO.</p><p>From prior projects the partners have extensive experience with using a combination of meetings of different sizes, ranging from visits of work groups, focus group meetings to large-scale meetings, particularly with the possible Data Integration, Generation and Stewardship Centres as they are proposed in WP3. The meeting types as well as their focus will be chosen during the project in function of the then-current needs.</p><p>The reports will be delivered as evolving, living documents in a wiki-based comments enabled platform integrated into the web site produced by WP1. The documents will be open to the whole project and the wider community for comment. We aim to keep the process as open as possible.</p><p>The partners are experienced in a wide range of computing services concerning data, models and processes.</p><p>Notably, the partners have pioneered the successful use of community champions, called “PALs”, as a closely bound working group with whom technical solutions are co-shaped.</p>",Male genome reprogramming by histone variants and histone modifications during spermatogenesis in the mouse,Center for Genomic Regulation (CRG),anistal,,1
